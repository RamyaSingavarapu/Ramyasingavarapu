## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ramya. Iâ€™m a former Capgemini employee, passionate about building Java full-stack applications

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small Java and Spring Boot projects to strengthen my backend development skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on Spring Boot, RESTful API development, and database integration using JPA/Hibernate and MongoDB to strengthen my backend expertise.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source or beginner-friendly Java projects, especially those involving Spring Boot or RESTful services.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java fundamentals, OOP concepts, and backend development â€” I enjoy discussing clean code and design principles.
